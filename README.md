# 7 Random Forest vs. Support Vector Machine Algorithm -- Classification

In this project, the titanic dataset on kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data, was used to build a random forest and support vector machine classifiers. The dataset includes the details on each passenger such as his/her age, sex, the cabin class, name, fare, ticket, etc. Each passenger destiny is labelled as 0 or 1 to indicate whether or not the passenger survived the disaster. In this project, the three features of age, sex, the cabin class were chosen as the independant variables. The passenger destiny is predicted through either random forest or support vector machine. 

## Understanding the data:
The chosen features, passengers' age, sex, and cabin class, were visualized in Fig. 1.
